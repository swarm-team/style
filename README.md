## Overview

Here's how the basic commit message should look.
"ðŸ˜„ UI Update: Redesigned Homepage to look more modern"

## Goal
Imagine your a dev on an instant messaging app with some friends.
Your busy with finals and you come back to continue adding private messages.
The one issue is that your codebase has completely changed, this is the commit history:

- "Pointing to Web by Baphomet" ""
- "Update user.ts by Baphomet" ""
- "Restructure Public and Private Apis by The Prophet" ""
- "Update user.ts by Baphomet" ""
- "Add friends by You" ""

You read it for some insight in where you code has gone so you can implement friend requests,
but the commit messages aren't much help. Clearly you need a system that better explains whats
going on without having to into the blame
